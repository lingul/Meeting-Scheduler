Short description: This is a web based application where you can setup meetings and invite people to vote on the meetings or ask them to comment/suggest another time. When developing I used a mac. As my server I used apache web server. For the database I used mysql version 8. And I have written my code in php with javascript.

Home Page: Application home page where the calendar resides and events are displayed.

Member Sign Up: Page for creation of new accounts.

Member Log In: Page to sign in with existing accounts.

Setup a new event: Create meetings. Click on the event in the calendar to get more information about the meeting.

Add attendens: Inviting participants to vote on meetings by email. The attendens list can be seen at the right top corner.

Voting: Invited participants can vote on meetings.

View event: The host of the event can see the votes and who voted what.

To use: Download the project and setup the database. Just run the file metadata.ddl in mysql and the database is set. Make sure you have a web-server. If you want to have a look at my ER-digram itÂ´s called modaldb.png and can be found under img.
